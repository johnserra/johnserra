## My Story

My career doesn't follow a straight line — and that's exactly the point.

I've led the re-engineering of a patented manufacturing process for a national food packaging company. I guided a language school through the abrupt chaos of a global pandemic, rebuilding its entire operation from paper to digital in a matter of weeks. Today, I develop new markets and strategic partnerships in the urban mobility space in Central New York.

What connects all of it is a single discipline: looking at a complex situation, finding the signal in the noise, and building something that works.

## What I Do Now

I'm an Account Manager at **Premium Parking**, where I focus on business development in the Central New York market. My work sits at the intersection of market research, lead generation, and strategic relationship-building. I'm currently architecting an automated business development engine to bring data-driven precision to what has traditionally been a manual process.

## How I Work

I'm a generalist by design. I believe that the most interesting problems live at the edges of disciplines — and that the best solutions usually come from someone willing to look across all of them.

My approach is simple: understand the problem deeply, use data to find clarity, build something concrete, and iterate.

## Beyond the Work

I'm a firm believer that who you are outside of work shapes how you think inside it.

I cook. Not as a hobby — as a practice. Making fresh pasta from scratch for a room full of people teaches you something about patience, craft, and the difference between performing and nurturing. Some of my best thinking has happened at a kitchen counter.

I also tinker. I analyze my own fitness data. I build automation tools for problems I find annoying. I'm fascinated by what becomes possible when you give a curious person the right set of tools.
