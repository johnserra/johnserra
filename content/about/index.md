## My Story

I don't have a linear career path; I have a toolkit built across industries.

I've led the re-engineering of a patented manufacturing process for a national food packaging company. I guided a language school through the abrupt chaos of a global pandemic, rebuilding its entire operation from paper to digital in a matter of weeks. Today, I develop new markets and strategic partnerships in the urban mobility space.

What connects all of it is a single discipline: looking at a complex situation, finding the signal in the noise, and building something that works.

## What I'm Building

I currently drive market growth and operational excellence within the urban mobility sector. My work sits at the intersection of technical strategy and human-centric execution. I’m less interested in just "managing accounts" and more focused on building the systems that allow a market to scale.

**Architecting Growth:** I am currently developing an automated business development engine to transform market research and lead generation from a manual grind into a data-driven precision tool.

**Scaling Culture:** I lead the recruitment, hiring, and training processes that ensure teams don’t just fill roles, but embody a specific culture of service excellence.

**Managing Complexity:** I bridge the gap between high-level client expectations and ground-level reality, maintaining the communication rhythms and visibility required to turn a contract into a long-term partnership.

## How I Work

I'm a Multi-disciplinary Problem Solver by design. I believe that the most interesting problems live at the edges of disciplines — and that the best solutions usually come from someone willing to look across all of them.

My approach is simple: understand the problem deeply, use data to find clarity, build something concrete, and iterate.

## Beyond the Work

I'm a firm believer that who you are outside of work shapes how you think inside it.

I cook. Not as a hobby — as a practice. Making fresh pasta from scratch for a room full of people teaches you something about patience, craft, and the difference between performing and nurturing. Some of my best thinking has happened at a kitchen counter.

I also tinker. I analyze my own fitness data. I build automation tools for problems I find annoying. I'm fascinated by what becomes possible when you give a curious person the right set of tools.
