After years of putting it off, I'm finally starting a blog.

I've always been a writer in my head — turning over ideas during a commute, drafting arguments in the shower, composing paragraphs while falling asleep. The problem was never a lack of things to say. It was the gap between thinking and publishing.

So here's the deal: this blog will be a mix of whatever's on my mind. That means professional topics — data, operations, technology — alongside more personal writing about food, travel, and the strange overlaps between all of those things.

## Why now?

Honestly, building this site forced my hand. Once the scaffolding was up, an empty blog directory felt like an accusation. So here we are.

## What to expect

I'm not committing to a schedule. What I'll commit to is writing when I have something worth saying — and trying to say it well.

If any of it resonates, I'd love to hear from you via the [contact page](/contact).

Thanks for reading.
