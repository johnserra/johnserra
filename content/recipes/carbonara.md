## Ingredients

- 200g spaghetti or rigatoni
- 150g guanciale (or pancetta if unavailable), cut into cubes
- 3 large egg yolks + 1 whole egg
- 80g Pecorino Romano, finely grated (plus extra to serve)
- Generous amount of coarsely cracked black pepper
- Salt (for pasta water only)

## Method

1. Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to boil. Cook pasta to al dente, reserving a full cup of pasta water before draining.

2. While pasta cooks, render guanciale in a cold pan on medium heat. Let the fat melt out slowly. Remove from heat once crispy. Do not drain the fat — it's the sauce base.

3. In a bowl, whisk egg yolks, whole egg, and Pecorino into a thick paste. Add a heavy hand of black pepper.

4. Drain pasta, add directly to the pan with guanciale (off the heat). Toss well.

5. Add the egg mixture and toss quickly, adding pasta water a splash at a time to loosen into a creamy sauce. The key: the pan must not be on heat when you add the eggs or they will scramble.

6. Plate immediately. Finish with more Pecorino and black pepper.

## Notes

The technique matters more than the recipe. The emulsion between the egg yolk, fat, and starchy pasta water is what makes carbonara carbonara. Work quickly, keep the pan off the heat, and use the pasta water generously.

Guanciale is non-negotiable if you can find it. The fat renders differently than pancetta and the flavor is richer.
