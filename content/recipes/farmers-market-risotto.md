## The Idea

This recipe doesn't have a fixed ingredient list — and that's the point. The technique is the constant; the vegetables are whatever was compelling at the market that morning.

The only rule: the ingredients have to earn their place. Risotto is a quiet dish. Everything you add becomes audible.

## The Base (Always the Same)

- 300g Arborio or Carnaroli rice
- 1 small onion or 2 shallots, finely diced
- 150ml dry white wine
- 1.2 liters warm vegetable or chicken stock
- 80g butter, cold and cubed
- 80g Parmigiano Reggiano, finely grated
- Good olive oil
- Salt and white pepper

## Seasonal Variations

### Spring
Asparagus tips, fresh peas, lemon zest, a handful of mint at the end.

### Summer
Zucchini blossoms, cherry tomatoes (added late, barely cooked), basil. Finish with no butter — just olive oil and Parmigiano.

### Autumn
Roasted butternut squash, sage browned in butter, toasted pumpkin seeds for texture.

### Winter
Radicchio and red wine instead of white. Bitter, beautiful, deeply savory.

## Method

1. **Warm the stock** in a separate pot and keep it at a gentle simmer throughout. Cold stock slows the starch release.

2. **Soften the onion** in olive oil and a knob of butter over medium-low heat until completely soft — 8 to 10 minutes. No color.

3. **Toast the rice** by adding it to the pan and stirring for 2 minutes until each grain is coated and slightly translucent at the edges.

4. **Add the wine** and stir until fully absorbed.

5. **Add stock one ladle at a time**, stirring almost constantly, waiting until each addition is absorbed before adding the next. This takes 18–22 minutes. Don't rush it.

6. **Add your market ingredients** at the right moment:
   - Delicate items (peas, herbs, zucchini blossoms): last 2 minutes or off the heat entirely
   - Firmer items (asparagus, squash): 5–8 minutes before the end
   - Pre-roasted items: folded in at the end

7. **Mantecatura** — the finish. Remove from heat when the rice is al dente and the mixture is slightly looser than you want it to end up. Add the cold butter and Parmigiano. Stir vigorously in a wave motion for 2 minutes until the risotto becomes creamy and glossy. Cover and rest 2 minutes.

8. Serve immediately. Risotto waits for no one.

## Notes

The mantecatura is what separates restaurant risotto from home risotto. Cold butter, off the heat, vigorous stirring. The emulsion that forms is the soul of the dish.

If it gets too thick before serving, a small splash of warm stock loosens it instantly.
