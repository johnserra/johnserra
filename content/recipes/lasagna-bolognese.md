## The Story

One of my most memorable meals was hosting my team at our home in Istanbul. In that work culture, a boss inviting everyone over was unusual, and my colleagues arrived intrigued — not quite sure what to expect.

Instead of a formal dinner, they found me in the kitchen, rolling out fresh pasta for lasagna. The act of making a meal like that from scratch is about more than just skill; it's an exercise in vulnerability. It immediately breaks down the walls between "boss" and "colleague." It's less about a performance and more about nurturing — creating something foundational and welcoming, right in front of them.

Sharing that meal did more to build our team than any formal meeting ever could. It's a philosophy I carry into my work: the best results come from genuine connection and a willingness to be open and human.

## Method

### Make the Ragù (Day Before if Possible)
1. Sauté onion, carrot, and celery in olive oil until soft — at least 15 minutes on low heat.
2. Add garlic, cook 2 more minutes.
3. Add ground meat. Brown thoroughly, breaking it up well.
4. Add white wine, let it reduce completely.
5. Stir in tomato paste, then crushed tomatoes, bay leaves, salt and pepper.
6. Add milk. Stir, then reduce heat to the lowest setting.
7. Simmer uncovered for at least 2 hours, stirring occasionally. The longer the better.

### Make the Pasta
1. Mound flour on a clean surface, make a well in the center.
2. Crack eggs into the well with salt. Beat gently with a fork, gradually incorporating flour.
3. Knead for 10 minutes until smooth and elastic.
4. Rest wrapped for 30 minutes.
5. Roll out thin with a pasta machine or rolling pin. Cut into sheets sized to your pan.
6. Parboil sheets briefly in salted water, cool flat on a clean towel.

### Make the Béchamel
1. Melt butter in a heavy pan. Add flour and stir constantly for 2 minutes.
2. Add warm milk gradually, whisking continuously to prevent lumps.
3. Cook on medium-low heat until thick. Season with nutmeg, salt, white pepper.

### Assemble
1. Preheat oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Spread a thin layer of béchamel on the bottom of the pan.
3. Layer: pasta sheet → ragù → béchamel → Parmigiano.
4. Repeat for 4–5 layers, finishing with béchamel and a generous covering of Parmigiano.
5. Bake 35–40 minutes until golden and bubbling. Rest 15 minutes before cutting.
