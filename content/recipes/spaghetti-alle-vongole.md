## Ingredients

- 500g fresh clams (vongole veraci), scrubbed and purged

## Method

1. **Purge the clams**: Soak in cold salted water (35g salt per liter) for 30 minutes minimum to remove sand. Discard any that are open and don't close when tapped.

2. Start pasta in heavily salted boiling water. Cook 2 minutes short of al dente — it finishes in the pan.

3. In a wide pan, warm olive oil over medium heat. Add garlic (and chili if using). Cook until fragrant, not browned.

4. Add clams and white wine. Cover immediately. Cook 3–4 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally, until all clams are open. Discard any that haven't opened.

5. Remove clams from pan. Pick the meat from most of them, leaving a handful in shell for presentation.

6. Add the al dente pasta to the pan with the clam liquid. Toss on medium heat, adding pasta water to build a light, silky sauce.

7. Return clam meat to pan. Finish with olive oil and parsley.

## Notes

The clam liquid is the sauce. Don't waste a drop of it. It should be just enough to coat the pasta — not soupy.

The quality of the clams is everything. Buy the freshest you can find, same day if possible.
