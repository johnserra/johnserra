## Ingredients

- 1 kg Yukon Gold or similar waxy potatoes, peeled and diced
- 2 large leeks, white and light green parts, sliced and well washed
- 4 shallots, thinly sliced
- 1 large yellow onion, diced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1.2 liters vegetable or chicken stock
- 200ml heavy cream (or crème fraîche)
- 3 tbsp butter
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- Fresh thyme, 4–5 sprigs
- Bay leaf
- Salt and white pepper
- Chives or green onion tops, to finish

## Method

1. **Build the allium base**: Melt butter with olive oil in a large heavy pot over medium-low heat. Add onion, shallots, and leeks with a generous pinch of salt. Cook slowly, stirring occasionally, for 20–25 minutes until completely soft and beginning to turn golden. Do not rush this step — it's the foundation of the flavor.

2. Add garlic and thyme sprigs. Cook 2 more minutes.

3. Add potatoes, bay leaf, and stock. Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce to a simmer.

4. Cook 20 minutes until potatoes are completely tender when pierced.

5. Remove thyme sprigs and bay leaf.

6. **Blend**: Use an immersion blender to blend until smooth. For a more rustic texture, blend only half and leave the rest chunky. Both are correct.

7. Stir in cream. Taste and adjust salt and white pepper.

8. Simmer gently for 5 more minutes. The soup should coat the back of a spoon.

## To Serve

Ladle into warm bowls. Finish with a drizzle of good olive oil or a small knob of butter melting on top. Scatter chives. Crack some black pepper.

Good bread is not optional.

## Notes

The triple-onion base is what makes this soup. Leeks bring sweetness and depth, shallots bring complexity, and onion brings body. Together they produce a richness that no single allium achieves alone.

This soup reheats beautifully and actually improves overnight as the flavors settle. It also freezes well — leave out the cream and add it when reheating.
